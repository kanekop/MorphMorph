# Security Overview

## Current Implementation Security Status

The current implementation of the Face Morphing application is secure with respect to sensitive data handling. Here's why:

### Safe Components
1. No hard-coded sensitive information
2. Uses standard libraries that don't require API keys:
   - OpenCV (cv2)
   - MediaPipe
   - Streamlit
   - NumPy

### Data Processing
- Images are processed locally without sending data to external services
- Uses Streamlit's built-in file uploader which handles file uploads securely

## Future Security Considerations

If adding features that require API keys or sensitive information in the future:

1. Use Replit's Secrets tool to store sensitive information
2. Access secrets in code using:
```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY_NAME")
```

This ensures that sensitive information remains:
- Encrypted
- Securely stored
- Not exposed in the codebase
- Not visible in version control
